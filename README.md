## ANALYSIS:
## Highest rated restaurants

The highest-rated restaurants are Emilianos, Michiko, and Restaurant Las Mananitas, all achieving perfect or near-perfect average ratings (2.00). Consumer preference strongly affects ratings. 

For example, Japanese cuisine, Coffee Shop, and Contemporary cuisine types top the list in consumer preference and also show high ratings. There is a positive correlation between consumer preference and restaurant rating—restaurants offering popular cuisines tend to perform better.

## Consumer demographics

The 18–25 age group dominates the consumer demographic, with 935 of 1380 respondents. Other age groups (26–35, 36–45, 46–60, 60+) are underrepresented.

The dataset is skewed toward younger consumers, which may bias the overall ratings and preferences.

## Demand and supply gaps

Mexican cuisine shows a significant demand-supply gap of 69 (97 preferences vs. 28 available restaurants).Other cuisines like Coffee Shop, American, Family, and Hot Dogs also show notable gaps.

These gaps represent underserved cuisine markets that can be exploited.

## Investment in a restaurant

High-rated restaurants generally fall under high budget/price level, closed area, full Bar or wine & beer alcohol service. 

Top restaurants share similar characteristics -premium pricing, private dining settings, and strong alcohol options.

## Budget Preferences vs Marital Status

Single consumers are more likely to have a medium or low budget preference.

Married consumers lean more toward medium budgets, suggesting slightly more financial flexibility.

## RECOMMENDATIONS & CONCLUSION

-	Invest in top-rated cuisines like Japanese and Coffee Shop, as they align with consumer preferences.

- Improve service quality—lowest average among ratings—to enhance overall customer experience.

- Focus marketing efforts on the 18–25 age group, which dominates the consumer base.

- Explore gaps in supply for Mexican, American, and Coffee Shop cuisines with high demand.

- Consider restaurants that are "Closed" (enclosed spaces) as they have slightly higher ratings.

- Offer alcohol services like "Full Bar" or "Wine & Beer" as they’re associated with higher ratings.

- Monitor price levels—high and medium-priced restaurants perform better in customer satisfaction.

Consumer preferences significantly influence restaurant ratings, especially for popular cuisines like Japanese and Coffee Shop. The dominance of younger consumers (ages 18–25) highlights a youthful, trend-driven market. There are clear demand-supply gaps in certain cuisines, creating strong opportunities for targeted expansion.

Service quality remains the weakest link, needing urgent improvement to match food expectations. Closed-area dining and alcohol availability are linked to higher satisfaction. Restaurants that align with preferred budget ranges and customer expectations stand out. Overall, data-driven strategies focused on demand, service, and demographic alignment can greatly enhance competitiveness and long-term success.
